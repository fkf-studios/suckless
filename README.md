It is actually Luke Smiths config but I just modified it a bit

# install
`git clone https://github.com/fkf-studios/suckless' 
```
cd suckless
cd dwm
sudo make install
cd ..
cd st
sudo make install
```
#keybinds
i will add the keybinds later...you can just view the keybinds in dwm/config.h 
NOTE: to paste in st its alt+v instead of ctrl+v
